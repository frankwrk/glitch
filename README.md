Welcome to the Elon Musk tribute page
=========================

This page was made for FreeCodeCamp "Tribute Page Challenge" using [Glitch](https://glitch.com) and [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) by Google.

**Glitch** is the friendly commmunity where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).

**Material Design Lite** lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible. [Get started now](https://getmdl.io/started/index.html).


Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
